# Team Building Exercise

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a Node.js command line application that takes information about employees and generates an HTML webpage the displays their information on individual cards.

## Challenges

The scope of this project was larger than anything I had worked on previously - I found it challenging to keep track of all the changes while writing the code.

## Installation

Run `npm i` to install all dependencies. Run `npm run test` to run the tests. After completing the inquirer prompts, open the `index.html` in the /dist folder to view the finished webpage.
