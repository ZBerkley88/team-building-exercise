# Team Building Exercise

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a Node.js command line application that takes information about employees and generates an HTML webpage the displays their information on individual cards.

## Challenges

The scope of this project was larger than anything I had worked on previously - I found it challenging to keep track of all the changes while writing the code.
